# CasinoGames
A casino simulator that currently features a die guessing game. In the current iteration, the game accepts user input for a guess, and compares it to a computer generated dice roll. If the player is correct, they win. The game is text based and is displayed using Swing. Continuing, I would like to begin an implementation of a Blackjack simulator. An end goal would be to create a GUI that encompasses the entire project, allowing the user to select which game they would like to play, and take the money they win at one game and play at another.
